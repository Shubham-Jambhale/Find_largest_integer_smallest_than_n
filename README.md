# Find_largest_integer_smallest_than_n

# Question :

Given an integer n, return a largest integer that is smaller than n, that can be created using
exchanging the position of any one pair of two digits of n. Return the same given integer if no
such integer can be formed. You may assume that none of the digits of n is 0. Expected time
complexity is O(N), where N is the number of digits in the given integer.

# Example 1 :

input: 572

output 527

Explanation: 527 is the largest integer smaller than n that can be formed by swapping the position of digit 7 & 2.

# Example 2:

input: 18256

output: 16258

Explanation: 16258 is the largest integer smaller than n that can be formed by swapping the position of digit 8 & 6.
